## demo[system management]
 basically you can use ex-sys for any purpose 
ex-sys was a management engine, alone with other modules adding to ex-sys,you can do anything you want with it
adding some of the massage transform modules
or system management module to personal usage 

if you using ex-sys to work,you can add some working related modules to the exsys for example,if you work as a Programmer, adding some files management module and adding work related modules, adding some modules between work would help .
